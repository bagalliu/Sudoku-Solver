# Sudoku-Solver
This project is a web-based Sudoku solver. It serves as a practical application and demonstration of computer science concepts related to NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time) problems. Sudoku is a classic example of an NP-Complete problem, a subset of NP problems, in the field of computational theory.
